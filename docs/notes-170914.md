Thoughts from Michael Franke

- It’s noteworthy and conceptually pleasing that the effects of the “null-utterance” seem to be obtainable also by assuming (more costly) negated terms like “not short” and “not tall” in the language. Technically interesting: null-utterance should be cheaper than “tall”; compositional “not tall” more costly than “tall” -> but same effect due to the functional binding of the forms in the latter case by a shared threshold value

- We should try a number of things, because this has potential to be really good:

- Krifka’s problem is not yet entirely solved; we should try what happens give “unhappy” the semantics of “neg [[happy]]” just like “not happy”; we should then have four levels of cost: happy < unhappy < not happy < not unhappy; the motivation is that “un-“ is still negation, but morphological and so slightly less complex as overt syntactic negation; it would be totally cool if this would predict the same ordering as what we had so far (I doubt it, but this would be the full solution to Krifka’s problem)
