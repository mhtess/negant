## Experiments run

- `0_L1`: interpretation, five sliders, 6 trials. $0.50
  - total experiment space: 6 items (cut down from 10)
  - target: 15 responses / item --> n = 18 (2 batches) ==> $9 + 1.8 = $10.80
  - 10/19/17: increase to 45 responses / items --> + n = 36 ==> $18 + 3.6 = 21.60
- `1_S0`: "literal semantics", forced choice task. 15 trials. $0.40
  - total experiment space: positive vs. antonym (2) x 6 points x 6 items (cut down from 10) = 72 unique conditions
  - target: 15 responses / item --> n = 72 (8 batches) ==> $28.8 + 5.76 = $34.56
- `2_L1`: interpretation, one slider at a time,  30 trials. $0.60
  - total experiment space: 6 adjective pairs (same as 0_L1)
  - target: 18 responses / item --> n = 18 (2 batches) ==> $10.80 + 2.16 = $12.96
