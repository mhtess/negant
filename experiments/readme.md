## Experiments run

- `0_L1`: interpretation, five sliders, 6 trials. $0.50
  - total experiment space: 6 items (cut down from 10)
  - target: 20 responses / item --> n = 20 ==> $10 + 2 = $14
- `1_S0`: "literal semantics", forced choice task. 15 trials. $0.40
  - total experiment space: positive vs. antonym (2) x 6 points x 6 items (cut down from 10) = 72 unique conditions
  - target: 15 responses / item --> n = 72 ==> $28.8 + 5.76 = $34.56
